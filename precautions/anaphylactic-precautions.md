# ANAPHYLACTIC PRECAUTIONS

**Anaphylaxis:**

* A generalized reaction occurring with dramatic suddenness (usually within a few minutes) after a patient has been exposed to some foreign material.

**Cause:**

* Any drug has the potential to precipitate anaphylaxis. Generally those administered intravenously or parenterally are more likely to result in life-threatening or fatal anaphylaxis than those ingested or applied to the skin or mucous membranes.

**Clinical features:**

* The patient with anaphylaxis may develop laryngeal edema and bronchospasm which cause respiratory distress and anoxia. The sooner the symptoms develop after the initiating stimulus the more intense the reaction. The symptoms include the following: generalized flush, urticaria, pruritus, anxiety, dyspnea, wheezing, choking, orthopnea, vomiting, cyanosis, paresthesia, shock, and loss of consciousness. Anoxia, shock, and death may occur within 5-10 minutes.
