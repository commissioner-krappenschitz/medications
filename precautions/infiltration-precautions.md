# INFILTRATION PRECAUTIONS

Before administering any IV medication or solution, the paramedic must check the IV site for patency and signs of infiltration and/or phlebitis. If infiltration occurs, stop the drug but do not remove the IV device. Contact the medical control physician immediately for orders.

**FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF INFILTRATION**

* Sclerotic vascular disease
* Venous obstruction in the arm (check for edema)
* Radiation treatment near the site of injection
* High drug concentration
* Limited choice for vein selection
* Multiple venipunctures
* Elderly or debilitated
* Superior vena cava syndrome
* Specific characteristics of the drug
* Uncooperative/irrational individual

**SYMPTOMS OF AN INFILTRATION**

If pain, burning or stinging occurs at the injection site, evaluate the site for swelling, redness, and inflammation. The presence of a blood return or absence of edema does not negate the possibility of the infuscate being spread outside the vein to surrounding tissue. Drug leakage may occur at the site of a previous vessel injury while the needle/catheter is still in the vein.

**IRRITANTS (DEXTROSE, DIAZEPAM)**

* **Definition:** An irritant is a medication that induces a local inflammatory reaction within the vein at the IV site.
* **Guidelines for reducing irritation:** The local irritation may be reduced by decreasing the infusion rate or by decreasing the drug concentration (increasing the diluent and/or increasing the intravenous solution flow rate while injecting the drug).

**VESICANTS (i.e. DOPAMINE)**

* **Definition:** A vesicant is a medication that induces blistering of tissues and may lead to tissue necrosis if the medication extravasates (infiltrates) from the vein into the surrounding tissue.
* **Guidelines to reduce the danger of infiltration:** Because the consequences may be severe to the patient, every effort to prevent infiltration must be implemented. The IV site must be observed frequently so that an infiltration can be identified early and further damage prevented.
* **Treatment Guidelines for Vesicant Infiltration:**
  * STOP INJECTION IMMEDIATELY: If possible leave the IV device in place. It may be possible to aspirate the drug or an antidote may be given through the device.
  * CALL MEDICAL CONTROL PHYSICIAN FOR INSTRUCTIONS
  * Report the reaction on arrival to the hospital and note infiltration on report form.
  * Apply cold compress if possible.
