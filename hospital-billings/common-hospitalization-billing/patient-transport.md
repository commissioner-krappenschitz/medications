# Patient Transport

The Eastdale City Medical Centers offers a free patient-transport to every Eastdalian who presents an identification card upon transporting -- _free patient-transport_ only applies **during emergency cases**. Meaning, if a patient does not need any emergency assistance/attention then they will be charged with no more or less than EC 1, 000.00.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example:

* A patient presents only non-severe coughs and they want to be transported to a hospital or their house, they will be charged.
* If a patient is involved in an MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident) that presents major lacerations/fractured bones, then they will be transported to the hospital immediately without any charges for transportation.
