# Oxygen (O2)

Oxygen is administered to patients with low SpO2 levels or are short of breath.

Normal dosage depends on what device is administering it. We carry Nasal Cannulas, Non-Rebreather Masks (NRB) and BVMs.

* Nasal Cannulas are **1-6 lpm**
* Non-Rebreather Masks are **10-15 lpm** (the bad on the NRM must remain inflated)
* BVMs are **15 lpm**
