# Metered-Dose Inhaler

Metered-Dose Inhaler (MDI) can be administered by an EMT if the patient has one and it is prescribed to them.

{% hint style="info" %}
Normal dosing varies on these MDIs so you must be able to read the instructions on the prescription and administer it according to the prescription. If you are not able to read the prescription the medication cannot be given by an EMT.
