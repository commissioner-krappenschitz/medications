# ADENOSINE (ADENOCARD®)

Class - Antidysrhythmics

Pharmacologic Action - Slows conduction through AV node and interrupts AV reentry pathways, which restore normal sinus symptoms

Indications – Conversion of regular, narrow complex tachycardia – stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or regular, monomorphic wide complex tachycardia

Contraindications – Hypersensitivity, second or third degree AV Block (except those on pacemakers), sick sinus syndrome, atrial flutter or fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia



**Warnings**

* Adenosine may produce a short period of first-, second-, or third-degree AV block as well as transient or prolonged asystole. Adenosine should be used with caution in patients taking digoxin and/or verapamil as cases of ventricular fibrillation have been reported. Adenosine administration may produce new arrhythmias during conversion. Adenosine may cause bronchoconstriction and/or respiratory compromise in asthma or COPD patients.



**Drug Interactions**

* Adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of digoxin or verapamil due to the potential for additive or synergistic effects. Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline antagonize the action of adenosine and may require higher doses. Dipyridamole (Persantine® , Aggrenox® ) potentiates the effect of adenosine; reduced doses may be effective. Carbamazepine (Tegretol® ) may increase the degree of heart block following adenosine administration.



**Adverse Reactions**

* Adenosine may result in facial flushing, diaphoresis, headache, chest pain, palpitations, hypotension, and shortness of breath, lightheadedness, paresthesia, or nausea.



**Dosage**

* _**Adult Stable Tachycardia:**_ If the rhythm is a narrow complex tachycardia, other than sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, at a rate exceeding 150 bpm:
  * Administer 6 mg adenosine (Adenocard® ) IV rapidly.
  * If there is no response to the initial 6 mg dose, administer 12 mg adenosine.
  * If there is no response to the second dose, administer 12 mg adenosine.
* _**Adult Unstable Tachycardia:**_ Consider adenosine administration for narrow complex tachycardia if IV access is readily available
  * Administer 6 mg adenosine (Adenocard® ) IV rapidly.
  * If there is no response to the initial 6 mg dose, administer 12 mg adenosine.
  * If there is no response to the second dose, administer 12 mg adenosine
* _**Pediatric Tachycardia:**_ If the rhythm is a narrow complex tachycardia (SVT) at a rate exceeding 180 in children > 1 year old or 220 in infants less than 1, administer adenosine (Adenocard® ) 0.1mg/kg IV max dose 6mg. May repeat at 0.2mg/kg IV max dose of 12mg.
