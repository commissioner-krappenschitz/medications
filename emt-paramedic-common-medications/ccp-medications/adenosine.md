# Adenosine

Adenosine is used to stop electrical activity in the heart temporarily to reset the rhythm and rate. When administer asystole is often noted on the monitor for a brief period of time then the underlying rhythm will appear. This medication causes a lot of anxiety as it causes chest pain and fear in some patients. However once the heart rhythm is returned to baseline the patient has a lot of relief.
