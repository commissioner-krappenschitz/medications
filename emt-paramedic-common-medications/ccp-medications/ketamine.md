# Ketamine

Ketamine is a sedative used to provide sedation to patients that are in a lot of pain and narcotics are not helping the pain and when patients need a procedure perform on them such as RSI.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ketamine is a good choice since it does not decrease respiratory effort. Excellent choice in treating patients with pain when we are unable to manage an airway (trapped inside of a vehicle, confined space).
