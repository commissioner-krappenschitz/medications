# Purpose & Preface

**PURPOSE:**

This Detailed Scene Cheat Sheet was created to make scenes more advanced and be done at a fast pace. Taking time to type up /me's for example takes ample time. These are ECMC's Patient Care Protocols based on Medic Certification and basic medical that one should know at their beginning stages of the department; they have been written to establish the standard of patient care. Any deviation from these protocols may create a lawsuit against yourself or the department. If something you think needs to be changed or added, please direct it to one of the Department Administration. These are not required to use while on-duty, but are here to help you and avoid mistakes.



**PREFACE:**

This book has been created to be a reference and a knowledge base for scenes within the Eastdale City Medical Center. These are the basic standing orders for the level starting from the moment you get accepted into the department and working as a Paramedic and EMT Certified.
